# Mapbox GL JS

This is repo is a fork of Mapbox GL JS with a `wapo` branch intended to track `mapbox/master` along with the following unmerged PRs:
 - #2982 (fix addSourceType for multiple map instances)
 - #2812 (bucket enhancements to allow property-only update)

`master` should track `mapbox/master`
